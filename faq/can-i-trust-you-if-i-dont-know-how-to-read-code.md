# How to verify legitamacy if I don't know code



We understand that uncertainty and fear affects non-technical farmers the most. Don't worry, the strawhat pirates are there for you.

99% of malicious activities happens in the smart contracts, so here is a very intuitive way of verifying the legitmacy of the project yourself.

The idea is simple, take the smart contract from a reputable source like Goose Finance, and compare the smart contract with ours.



**Heres how you can do it**

1. Go to the 'Contracts' section and view the contracts on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)
2. Go to a reputable source \(we forked from Goose Finance\), and access their contracts as well
3. Go to [https://www.diffchecker.com/](https://www.diffchecker.com/) and paste both of the codes in to check the difference
4. You can then see that, there is no malicious change in the contract, and it is 100% safe \(The only changes are changes to the names of the tokens and variable names\)
