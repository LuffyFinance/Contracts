# Can I trust you if I don't know how to read code?



We were in your shoes once, and totally understand the confusion if you do not know how to read code. How are you guys supposed to know if what we say is true? Don't worry, we got you guys covered.

First, go to the 'Contracts' section and view the contracts on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)

Next, go to a reputable source \(we forked from Goose Finance\), and access their contracts as well.

1. Go to the 'Contracts' section and view the contracts on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)
2. Go to a reputable source \(we forked from Goose Finance\), and access their contracts as well
3. Go to [https://www.diffchecker.com/](https://www.diffchecker.com/) and paste both of the codes in to check the difference
4. You can then see that, there is no malicious change in the contract, and it is 100% safe \(The only changes are changes to the names of the tokens and variable names\)
