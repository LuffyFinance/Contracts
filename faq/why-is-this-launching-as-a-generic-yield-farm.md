# Why is this launching as a generic yield farm?

Many people are wary of generic yield farms, as it always seems lackluster. However, we made this decision as a team, because we also realize that there are many people that are cautious of 'innovative' contracts that bring in new concepts and technology to the yield farm space. Hence, we decided to start off with a generic yield farm and make sure that we build up the trust in the community as trusted developers, and then once we have a strong community, we would push on to new changes like stated in the roadmap, and grow this project steadily.

If you do not trust us, that is fine, but we are 100% transparent and you can come back to invest once our project has grown large enough.
