# Is the project safe ?

Being crypto investors ourselves, we understand the fear and uncertainty that people face when participating in yield farms. The problem is with unethical developers that profit off the losses of their community.

As such, we decided to create our own crypto platform that will act as a safe space for farmers to grow together. And we don't say this just for fun.

We prioritizehonesty and transparency, here is a list of safety nets we have taken in order to ensure that there is no way that we can rug or drain the community. 

* [ ] No Migrator Code 
* [ ] No Additional Proxy Contracts
* [ ] Utilize a Timelock Contract \(will be activated after fair launch\)
* [ ] Initial Liquidity Burned \(will be done right after fair launch\)

For non-technical users, it is wise to not take our word for it and verify the safety of the project yourself.
