# Is it safe

Recently, there has been a lot of rug pulls in yield farms, and honestly, as a team that has played in yield farms before, we understand the anxiety and uncertainty that is faced by farmers that decide to put their money in a new yield farm. 

That is why as a team, we decided to create a safe environment to farm, and it's not just empty words. 

Here is a list of safety measurements we have taken in order to ensure that there is no way that we can rug or drain.

* [ ] Migrator Code Removed
* [ ] No Additional Proxy Contracts
* [ ] Timelock Contract \(will be activated after fair launch\)
* [ ] Initial Liquidity Burned \(will be done right after fair launch\)

For farmers that do not know how to read code, and do not want to take our word for it but would want to verify for yourselves, do head over to the next section to read up more.
